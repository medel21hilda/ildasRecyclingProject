		<h2>People should not use plastic bags because they do not destroy naturally, litter the landscape and kill animals. </h2>

		<p> One of the worst environmental effects is that plastic bags cannot be destroyed naturally.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They are made of petroleum.</li>
			<li>The decomposition takes about 400 years. No one will live so long to witness the decomposition of the plastic bag.</li>
			<li>And to make plastic bags, 60 to 100 million barrels of oil are needed every year around the world.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Plastic bags litter the landscape.</h3>

		<p> Plastic bags litter the landscape. Once they are used, most bags go into landfills.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li> Each year, more and more bags are ending up littering the environment.</li>
        	<li> Once they become litter, plastic bags find their way into the oceans, rivers, parks, and streets.</li>
        	<li> If they are burned, they infuse the air with toxic fuel.</li></ul>
        <br>

        <h3> Plastic bags kill animals.</h3>

        <p> Plastic bags kill animals.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li> About 100,000 marine animals, such as dolphins, turtles, and others are killed by plastic bags.</li>
        	<li> Many animals ingest plastic bags, mistaking them for food, and therefore, they die.</li>
        	<li> And worse, the ingested plastic bag remains intact even after the death and decomposition of the animal.</li> 
        	<li> In addition, they lie around in the landscape where another victim may eat it again.</li>
        </ul>
